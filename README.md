Object Detection & Tracking Prototype

Project Overview

This project implements a basic object detection and tracking system using a pretrained YOLOv8 model. The system detects objects in video frames, assigns tracking IDs across frames using centroid-based tracking logic, and generates summary statistics such as object counts and tracking duration.
The prototype runs locally and produces an annotated output video along with a CSV summary file.

Technologies Used

Python
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) – Object detection
OpenCV – Video processing
NumPy & Pandas – Data handling and statistics

Features

Object detection from video frames
Tracking objects across frames
Unique tracking ID assignment
Output video with bounding boxes and IDs
CSV summary with object statistics

How to Run
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Place input video:
input_video.mp4

Run:
python main.py

Output Generated:
output/tracked_output.mp4 → Annotated output video
output/object_summary.csv → Summary statistics

Limitations:

Simple centroid tracker may assign new IDs if objects move abruptly or detection fluctuates.
No model fine-tuning performed (pretrained weights used).

Future Improvements:

Use advanced tracking algorithms (DeepSORT, ByteTrack)
Fine-tune detection model for specific datasets
Real-time analytics dashboard integration
